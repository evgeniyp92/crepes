# Build notes part 2

## Handling stray api requests

If you have a request that makes it past all your routes you should then have a catch-all route to respond with a 404

Instead of declaring a bunch of `app.verbs` you can just use `app.all()`

```javascript
app.all('*', (request, response, next) => {
    response.status(404).json({
        status: 'fail',
        message: `Route ${request.originalUrl} does not exist`,
    });
});
```
