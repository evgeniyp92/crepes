# Mongo Data Modeling

One of the hardest parts of development is correctly modeling data

Data modeling is the process of taking data from a real world scenario and turning it into a structured and logical data model

In an example of an online shop theres a lot of sets of data that need to be modeled

So we turn that jumble into a set of logical data sets and connections between the data

Data modeling is not always straightforward and there isnt always a right answer

- Identify types of relationships between data
- Understand referencing vs embedding
- Understand when to reference vs embed
- Understand types of referencing

## Types of relationships

- One to One
  - Movie can only have one name
- One to Many (1:FEW/1:MANY/1:LOADS)
  - Movie can win a few awards (1:10-100s)
  - Movie can have many reviews (1:1000-10000s)
  - Apps can have tons of log events (if something can expand indefinitely its a 1:LOADS)
- Many to Many
  - Many movies can have many various actors in them

## Referencing vs Embedding

Referencing is when you list the id of the object you want to reference in your document
Embedding is when the contained document is embedded in the parent document from the start

Normalized documents can be denormalized at will but not the other way around

If you have datasets that are inextricably linked, use embedding
If you have datasets that need to be referenced on their own, use referencing

## When to embed vs when to reference

|        Criterion        |                   Embedding                    |       Referencing        |
| :---------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: | :----------------------: |
|    Relationship type    |                  1:FEW/1:MANY                  | 1:MANY/1:LOADS/MANY:MANY |
| How often data is read  |             Read/Write ratio high              |   Read/Write ratio low   |
| How related is the data | Doesnt make sense to query the data separately |           Does           |

## Types of referencing

- Child referencing
  - Parent is aware of all of its children
  - Child doesnt know about its parent
  - Tightly couples parent and children
- Parent referencing
  - Parent doesnt know about all of its children
  - Child is aware of its parent
- Two-way referencing
  - Parent is aware of all of its children
  - Child is aware of all of its parents

Generally the more skewed the relationship the more parent referencing makes sense

BSON documents are limited to 16MB so minimizing the amount of data resulting from a query is a good idea

Never allow an array in a document to grow indefinitely

## Summary

- Structure the data to match the ways that your applicaiton will query and update data. In other words, identify the questions that arise from your application's use cases and then model your data so that the questions get answered in the most efficient way
- Generally, favor embedding unless there is a good reason not to embed
- 1:TON or MANY:MANY is a good reason to reference or when the data is updated a lot or needs to be accessed on its own
- Use embedding when data is read a lot but not updated a lot, or when two datasets belong together intrinsically
- Dont allow an array to grow indefinitely
- Use two-way referencing in many:many relationships

# Code notes

Creating embedded documents (using arrays)

```javascript
    startLocation: {
      // GeoJSON
      type: {
        type: String,
        default: 'Point',
        enum: ['Point'],
      },
      coordinates: [Number],
      address: String,
      desscription: String,
    },
    locations: [
      {
        type: {
          type: String,
          default: 'Point',
          enum: ['Point'],
        },
        coordinates: [Number],
        address: String,
        description: String,
        day: Number,
      },
    ],
```

Embedding user documents into tour documents
