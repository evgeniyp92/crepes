# Natours build notes

## Express

Express is a minimal node framework thats built on node using node code

Has a very robust set of features

- complex routing
- easier handling of requests and responses
- middleware
- ssr

this saves us the trouble of having to reinvent the wheel when we config an api

express also makes it easier to organize our app into an mvc architecture

it is convention to configure all of express in app.js

Initializing express

```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

const PORT = 4000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`App running on port ${PORT}...`);
});
```

basic route

```javascript
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  response.status(200).send('Hello from the server side!');
});
```

sending json instead of plain text

```javascript
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  response.status(200).json({
    message: `Hello from the server side!`,
    app: 'Natours',
  });
});
```

the http 200 response is default so you dont have to explicitly set it

also the json method automatically sets the header to app/json

## APIs and RESTful API design

An API is a piece of software that is used by another piece of software to allow apps to talk to each other

So it's a facilitator application

This can mean a Web API, or something smaller like `fs` or `http`, the DOM JS API, publicly exposed methods in oop, etc etc

### REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer

It's a logical way of building API's making them easy to consume

- Separate API into logical resources
  - Key abstraction of info in REST
  - A resource is an object or representation of something with some data associated to it
  - i.e. tours, users, reviews (all nouns)
- Exposed them via structured, resource-based URLS,
  - endpoints should only contain resources and not the actions to be performed on them
  - i.e. instead of `/getTour` use `/tours` with a `GET` method
  - common verbs are GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH (only supply whats been changed), PUT (send the entire object)
- Use the right HTTP methods (verbs)
  - Follow the CRUDL operations if possible
- Send data as JSON where possible
  - Nice for both computers and humans to understand
  - Expandable with things like JSend (envelops data to imporove security and make response status explicit)
- Be stateless
  - All state is handled on the client and not on the server
  - Like loggedIn or currentPage
  - So all information to process the request must be included in it
  - The server shouldnt keep anything in memory
  - i.e. instead of making the server track what the currentpage is, request pages explicitly

The request data holds what was sent but Express cant access it by default so we need middleware -- add `app.use(express.json())` to get express to receive the body

## The request-response cycle

- Our app receives a request
- It generates a request and a response object
- We use middleware to process the request (like `express.json` (aka bodyparser))
- The order of middlewares in the stack is defined by their order in the code

```javascript
// adding an additional function to the middleware stack
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // we get access to the request, response, and the next function
  console.log('Hello from our custom middleware ðŸ’©');
  // without calling the next function the flow would hang
  next();
});
```

When middleware is declared globally it will run everywhere but it is possible to have middleware run for only specific route handlers, depending when the middleware is declared

```javascript
// faster way of declaring routes than above
// declare the endpoint and then chain all applicable methods
app.route('/api/v1/tours').get(getAllTours).post(createTour);
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // we get access to the request, response, and the next function
  console.log('Hello from our custom middleware ðŸ’©');
  // without calling the next function the flow would hang
  next();
});
app
  .route('/api/v1/tours/:id')
  .get(getTour)
  .patch(updateTour)
  .delete(deleteTour);
```

route handlers typically are at the end of the request response cycle so the custom middleware is not used

adding additional data to the request object to be consumed at a later point

```javascript
// manipulating the request object
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // appending the time of the request to the request
  // @ts-ignore
  req.currentTime = new Date().toISOString();
  next();
});

const getAllTours = (request, response) => {
  console.log(request.currentTime);
  response.json({
    status: 'success',
    requestedAt: request.currentTime,
    results: tours.length,
    data: {
      tours,
    },
  });
};
```
