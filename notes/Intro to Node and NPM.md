# Introduction to Node and NPM

Node is fundamentally a Javascript runtime

Node.js uses V8 to run JS code

## Now that JS is outside the browser it makes JS much more powerful

You can finally use JS on the server side of development

### It is great for backend development because

- Node is singlethreaded and based on an event driven non-blocking IO model
- Its perfect for building fast and scalable data intensive apps
- JS across the entire stack means faster and more efficient development
- NPM is an enormous library of open-source packages available to everyone for free
- The developer community is very active

### Node uses

- API with DB (preferably NoSQL)
- Data streaming (Youtube)
- Real-time chat application
- Server-side web application

### Don't use node for

- Heavy server side processing (better to use RoR, php or python)

# Using modules

To run javascript with node simply call node with the path to the file you wish to run

The node docs are available at the nodejs website
